# Notepad-using-Python

I implemented a notepad using Python.
It includes all the basic Functionalities of a notepad like:
1. Creating a new File
2. Opening an existing File
3. Save a document, etc.

The UI of the notebook looks like 
<img src = "https://github.com/vmbansal2001/Notepad-using-Python/blob/master/Notepad%20Screenshot.png">
It is a very clean and basic UI, very easy to use and very easy to understand.

I used the Tkinter Library to provide this GUI to the notebook, else the backend code of this notepad is written in python.
Any new suggestions or feedback are open for this project.
